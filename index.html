<h1>Welcome To Hell (aka Unity's Website)</h1>

<div id="Intro">
<h2>Introduction!</h2>
<p>Ayy lmao, I made a website.  I'm not sure <em>what</em> I plan to do with this site, but for the moment it's just a place for me to fuck around in HTML and whatnot.  Who knows, one day it may have some sort of purpose, but until then, it's just a garble of shit on my part.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm Unity--but you can call me <em>Unity</em>.  I drink coffee and delete spam all day off the site I moderate for, Finalchan.net.  It's pretty crappy, but at least the people are somewhat friendly.  I'm 17 at the time of making this and hope I can look back on the making of this page in flurry of cringiness.</p>
